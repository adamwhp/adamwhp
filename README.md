### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Adam](https://moonpixels.co.uk), a full stack web application developer from the UK.

I work as the Senior Software Engineer at [Veezu](https://veezu.co.uk), building and maintaining the software that
powers the UK's fastest growing multi-region private hire company.

During my spare time I like to build smaller web applications through my freelance
company [Moon Pixels](https://moonpixels.co.uk).

My development stack of choice is Laravel, Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.
