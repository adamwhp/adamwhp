### Hello 👋

I’m [Adam](https://moonpixels.co.uk), a UK-based freelance web developer specialising in Laravel and modern PHP, available for contract work through my company [Moon Pixels](https://moonpixels.co.uk).

I help businesses replace manual processes with well-designed web applications and internal tools. Most of my day-to-day work is Laravel and PHP, and I enjoy working with React, React Native, and Vue on the frontend.

I’m a big fan of clean code, simple solutions, and systems that are easy to maintain long-term.

If you’re working on something interesting and want to collaborate, feel free to get in touch.
