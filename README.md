### Hello 👋

I'm [Adam](https://moonpixels.co.uk), a full stack web application developer from the UK.

Currently serving as Lead Software Engineer at [Veezu](https://veezu.co.uk), building and maintaining the software that
powers the UK's fastest growing multi-region private hire company.

I'm also available as an independent contractor through my company [Moon Pixels](https://moonpixels.co.uk).

My development stack of choice is Laravel on the backend, with the frontend powered by React or Vue and styled using Tailwind CSS.
